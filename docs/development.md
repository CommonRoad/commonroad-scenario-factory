# Development

For the development of the `commonroad-scenario-factory` we recommend [python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [poetry](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To get started with development, clone the repo and install all dependencies:

```sh
$ poetry install --with tests --with docs --with dev
```
