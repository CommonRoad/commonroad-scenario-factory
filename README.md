# Generation of CommonRoad Scenarios with SUMO

This repo refactors code which was developed mainly by Moritz Klischat. It is used for the generation of interactive and non-interactive CommonRoad traffic scenario, as used, e.g., in the CommonRoad competition. 

# Previous Version
The [backup](backup) directory contains an [installation guide](backup/installation_guide_scenariofactory.txt) for installing an out-of-date and buggy version of the scenario factory as well as a required [python script](backup/generate_interactive_senarios.py).
